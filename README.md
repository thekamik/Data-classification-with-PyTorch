# Data-classification-with-PyTorch
Simple data classification with PyTorch neural network.

1. This project was developed to show a minimalist implementation of PyTorch for data classification problems. <br />
The data used in this project was downloaded from the kaggle website. <br/>

2. To run this code you need to install: <br />
   a.) Install the PyTorch library (this code was developed using pytorch 2.2.1 with CUDA 12.1 support on a windows machine):<br />
   ```sh
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   ```
   b.) Install Pandas
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```
   <br />
   
3. If you find a bug or have an idea to improve the program, please e-mail me.
